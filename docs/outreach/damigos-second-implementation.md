# Outreach draft — Matthew Damigos / Ionian University

**Recipient:** Matthew Damigos, Laboratory on Digital Libraries and Electronic Publishing, Ionian University. Most discoverable contact: [`dlib.ionio.gr`](https://dlib.ionio.gr/) or via the GitHub org [`DLIB-Ionian-University`](https://github.com/DLIB-Ionian-University).
**Outcome we want:** open conversation about the Corfu Criminal Court Archives RiC-CM application running our conformance probe. Secondary outcome: align on the RiC-CM Nav vs OpenRiC RiC-CM browser overlap.
**Status:** draft, ready to send once v0.38.0 is on `origin/main`.

## Body

Hi Matthew,

I work on [OpenRiC](https://openric.org) — an open, implementation-neutral HTTP/API contract for RiC-aligned archival data, with a spec + reference Laravel API + viewer + capture client + conformance probe, all CC-BY/AGPL. We just remediated the spec for full RiC-O 1.1 conformance (v0.37.x, this week — zero non-canonical `rico:*` emissions remain).

Two reasons I'm writing.

**1. The Corfu Criminal Court Archives application is the closest production RiC-CM deployment I've found to a candidate second implementation of OpenRiC.** Our v1.0 freeze is gated on at least one non-reference implementation passing the conformance probe. Looking at your published work (the [2025-09 Corfu RiC-CM deployment](https://dlib-ionian-university.github.io/), the [2023 ICADL paper on RiC-CM ↔ CIDOC-CRM mapping](https://link.springer.com/), and the [2026 RiC-CM Nav](https://dlib-ionian-university.github.io/ric-cm-nav/)), your group is one of the few outside the EGAD core teams that's built sustained RiC-CM tooling at production scale.

The OpenRiC conformance probe is pure shell + jq. The minimum bar is the [`core-discovery` profile](https://openric.org/spec/profiles/core-discovery.html) — read-only access to records, agents, repositories, vocabulary, autocomplete, plus a few SHACL shapes. **I'm not asking for a commitment** — but if your Corfu archives system already exposes records, agents, and a vocabulary endpoint over HTTP (in any shape), we could probably probe it today and tell you whether the gap to OpenRiC `core-discovery` is small or significant. If small, adopting the profile is a low-effort visibility win for both of us.

**2. The two RiC-CM navigators.** Your group ships [RiC-CM Nav](https://dlib-ionian-university.github.io/ric-cm-nav/), listed on the official ICA RiC ResourceList. We ship our own RiC-CM browser at [`ric.theahg.co.za/reference/ric-cm/`](https://ric.theahg.co.za/reference/ric-cm/) (SPARQL-backed against the canonical RiC-O 1.1 ontology, with declared-vs-inherited separation per CIDOC-CRM-style page browsers). Right now both exist, the relationship between them is undeclared, and that's noted on our [drift log](https://openric.org/drift-log.html) as something to resolve.

I'd like to understand what RiC-CM Nav does that ours doesn't (and vice versa). The cleanest outcome would be one of:

- Our browser deprecates and links out to yours, with the gaps we miss filed as issues against your repo.
- Your browser links to ours for the use cases ours covers better.
- We merge — likely by us contributing to `DLIB-Ionian-University/ric-cm-nav` rather than the reverse.

A separate but related question: your 2023 ICADL paper on the RiC-CM ↔ CIDOC-CRM mapping is the basis for what OpenRiC is calling [`OpenRiC-CIDOC-Bridge`](https://github.com/openric/spec/blob/main/docs/extensions/openric-cidoc-bridge.md) — a post-v1.0 extension proposal to express RiC-O graphs in CIDOC-CRM-equivalent form for museum interoperability. **We have NOT done the mapping work** — it would be straightforwardly built on yours, with attribution. If you'd be open to that being framed as a joint Ionian / OpenRiC extension, I think it would land more credibly with both the archive and the museum communities.

Happy to start with whichever of the three threads feels easiest. A 20-minute call works for me; equally happy with line-by-line over GitHub on `openric/spec`.

## Pre-send checklist

- [ ] v0.38.0 (SPARQL Access + drift-log + Related Implementations updates) on `origin/main`
- [ ] [`docs/extensions/openric-cidoc-bridge.md`](https://github.com/openric/spec/blob/main/docs/extensions/openric-cidoc-bridge.md) exists and renders
- [ ] [`drift-log.html`](https://openric.org/drift-log.html) carries the RiC-CM navigator reconciliation entry
- [ ] [`related-implementations.html`](https://openric.org/related-implementations.html) carries the Damigos / Ionian section
